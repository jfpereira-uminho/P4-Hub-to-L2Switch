# **P4 Network Programming: From Hub to L2 Switch**

Welcome to the **P4 Hub to L2 Switch** repository! This repository contains starter code for a simple network device written in P4. Currently, the device behaves as a **hub**, broadcasting all incoming packets to all connected ports. 

Your task is to transform this hub into an **L2 switch** that forwards packets based on a **static MAC address table**. The table will be pre-populated by the control plane when the switch is initialized.

---

## **What Youâ€™ll Learn**
By completing this task, you will:
- Understand the difference between **hub** and **L2 switch** behavior.
- Learn how to use **P4 tables** for exact-match lookups.
- Gain hands-on experience programming network devices with **P4**.

---

## **Task Description**

### **Hub Behavior (Current State)**:
The provided `hub.p4` program:
- **Broadcasts** every packet it receives to all ports except the ingress port.
- Does not inspect or process packet headers.

### **L2 Switch Behavior (Your Goal)**:
Modify `hub.p4` to implement an **L2 switch** with the following behavior:
1. **MAC Address Table**:
   - Create a table that maps destination MAC addresses to specific egress ports.
   - This table will be pre-populated by the control plane.
2. **Forwarding Logic**:
   - For packets with a **known destination MAC**, forward them to the corresponding port.
   - For packets with an **unknown destination MAC**, broadcast them to all ports except the ingress port.

## **Hub Scenario**
### Compile
```bash
p4c-bm2-ss --std p4-16  p4/task1-hub.p4 -o json/task1-hub.json
```

### Run
```bash
sudo python3 mininet/task1-topo.py --json json/task1-hub.json
```

### Load flow rules
```bash
simple_switch_CLI --thrift-port 9090 < flows/flows.txt
```

### Test
```bash
mininet> h1 ping h2 -c 5
```

## Debugging Tips

Here are some useful commands to help troubleshoot and verify your topology:

### 1. **Wireshark (Packet Capture)**

### 2. **ARP Table Inspection**
   - **Command:** `arp -n`
   - **Usage:** Check the ARP table on any Mininet host to ensure proper IP-to-MAC Default gateway resolution.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     mininet> h1 arp -n
     ```

### 3. **Interface Information**
   - **Command:** `ip link`
   - **Usage:** Display the state and configuration of network interfaces for each host or router.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     mininet> s1 ip link
     ```

### 4. **P4 Runtime Client for Monitoring**
   - **Command:** `sudo ./tools/nanomsg_client.py --thrift-port <r1_port or r2_port>`
   - **Usage:** Interact with the P4 runtime to inspect flow tables and rules loaded on each router.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     sudo ./tools/nanomsg_client.py --thrift-port 9090
     ```
